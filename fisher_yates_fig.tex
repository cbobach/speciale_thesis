\caption{Fisher-Yates algorithm in action: In this figure a 9 out of 52 shuffle has been completed to ilustrade how the algorithm works. First 1 is swpaed with 1. Then 2 is swaped with 51. 3 with 14. 4 with 20 and so on until the first 9 numbers has completed a full permutation. Resulting in 1, 51, 14, 20, 10, 37, 9, 33, 6.}
