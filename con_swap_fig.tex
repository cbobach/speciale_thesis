\caption{Conditional swap algorithm in action: In this figure a 9 out of 52 shuffle has been completed to ilustrade how the algorithm works. Each bit in the $seeds$ indicate if a gate should be swapped. Since the size of $seeds$ is so big I have tried to ilustrate which wire each value is located at before moved in a layer resulting in 1, 51, 14, 20, 10, 37, 9, 33, 6.}
